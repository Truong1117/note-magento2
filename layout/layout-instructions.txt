Manage layouts

~ To make layout changes available on every page, modify the default.xml file. 

~ For example, layout changes added to app/code/Vendor/Module/view/frontend/layout/default.xml 
are loaded on all pages. 

~ Use these layout instructions to:

	~~ Move a page element to another parent element.
	~~ Add content.
	~~ Remove a page element.
	~~ Arrange the element position.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I. Common layout instructions

1. block:
Details: A block is a unit of page output that renders some distinctive content 
(anything visually tangible for the end-user), such as a piece of information or a user interface element.

Ex: <block class="Magento\Catalog\Block\Product\ListProduct" name="category.products.list" as="product_list" template="Magento_Catalog::product/list.phtml"/>

2. container:

A structure without content that holds other layout elements such as blocks and containers.

Details: A container renders child elements during view output generation. It can be empty or it can 
contain an arbitrary set of <container> and <block> elements. If the <container> is empty, and there is 
no child <block> available, it will not be displayed in the frontend source code.

Ex: 
<container name="div.sidebar.additional" htmlTag="div" htmlClass="sidebar sidebar-additional" after="div.sidebar.main">
    <container name="sidebar.additional" as="sidebar_additional" label="Sidebar Additional"/>
</container>

3. block vs. container

~ Blocks represents the end of the chain in rendering HTML for Magento.

~ Containers contain blocks and can wrap them in an HTML tag.

~ Containers do not render any output if there are no children assigned to them.


4. before and after attributes


ATTRIBUTE	VALUE		DESCRIPTION

before		Dash (-)	The block displays before all other elements in its parent node.

before		[element name]	The block displays before the named element.

before	Empty value or [element name] is absent	Use the value of after. If that value is empty or absent as well, the element is considered as non-positioned.

after		Dash (-)	The block displays after all other elements in its parent node.

after		[element name]	The block displays after the named element.

after	Empty value or [element name] is absent	Use the value of before. If that value is empty or absent as well, the block is considered as non-positioned.
