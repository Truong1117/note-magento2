II. Customize product view pages

Use containers on the product page to structure content in the layout. You can reference the container and add blocks to it.

Containers assign content structure to a page using container tags within a layout XML file. A container has no additional content
except the content of included elements. Examples of containers include:

~ product.info.main

~ product.info.price

~ product.info.stock.sku

~ product.info.form.content

~ product.info.extrahint

~ product.info.social

~ product.info.media

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example

<move element="product.info.social" destination="product.info.main" before="product.info.price"/>
