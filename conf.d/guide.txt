cd /etc/nginx/conf.d

check it: sudo netstat -tulpn

Get the PID of the process that uses port 80 or 443. And send the kill command changing the <PID> value:

sudo kill -2 <PID>

Note in my example the PID value of Apache was 1762 so I would execute sudo kill -2 1762

Aternatively you can execute the following:

sudo fuser -k 80/tcp

sudo fuser -k 443/tcp

Now that port 80 or 443 is clear, you can start Nginx by running the following:

sudo service nginx restart
