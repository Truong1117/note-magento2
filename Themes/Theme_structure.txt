Magento theme structure

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I. Magento theme location

~ Storefront themes are conventionally located under app/design/frontend/<Vendor>/. 
Though technically they can reside in other directories. For example Magento built-in themes 
can be located under vendor/magento/theme-frontend-<theme_code> when a Magento instance is deployed 
from the Composer repository.

~ Each theme must be stored in a separate directory:

app/design/frontend/<Vendor>/
├── <theme1>
├── <theme2>/
├── <theme3>
├--...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
II. Theme components
~ The structure of a Magento theme directory typically would be like following:

<theme_dir>/
├── <Vendor>_<Module>/
│   ├── web/
│   │   ├── css/
│   │   │   ├── source/
│   ├── layout/
│   │   ├── override/
│   ├── templates/
├── etc/
├── i18n/
├── media/
├── web/
│   ├── css/
│   │   ├── source/
│   ├── fonts/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── js/
├── composer.json
├── registration.php
├── theme.xml

~ Let’s have a closer look at each particular sub-directory.

III. Theme files
Apart from the configuration file and theme metadata file, 
all theme files fall into the following two categories:

~ Static view files

~ Dynamic view files

1. Static view files
A set of theme files that are returned by the server to a browser as is, 
without any processing, are called the static files of a theme.

2. Static files can be located in a theme directory as follows:

<theme_dir>/
├── media/
├── web
│   ├── css/ (except the "source" sub-directory)
│   ├── fonts/
│   ├── images/
│   ├── js/

~ The key difference between static files and other theme files is that static files appear on a web page
 as references to the files, while other theme files take part in the page generation, 
but are not explicitly referenced on a web page as files.

~ Static view files that can be accessed by a direct link from the storefront, 
are distinguished as public theme files.


3. Dynamic view files
~ View files that are processed or executed by the server in order to provide result to the client. \
These are: .less files, templates, and layouts.

~ Dynamic view files are located in a theme directory as follows:

<theme_dir>/
├── Magento_<module>/
│   ├── web/
│   │   ├── css/
│   │   │   ├── source/
│   ├── layout/
│   │   ├── override/
│   ├── templates/
├── web/
│   ├── css/
│   │   ├── source/
