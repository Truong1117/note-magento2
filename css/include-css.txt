I. How Magento stylesheet files are organized

~ In a theme directory, stylesheets are stored in the following locations:

DIRECTORY, RELATIVE TO <THEME_DIR>			DESCRIPTION

/<Namespace>_<Module>/web/css			Module-specific styles.

/web/css					Contains the following:
				print.less: used to generate styles for the printed version of store pages.
				_styles.less - a composite file, which includes all Less files used in the theme. The underscore sign ("_") in a file name conventionally means that a file is not used independently, but is included in other files.
				styles-m.less: used to generate mobile-specific styles, includes _styles.less.
				styles-l.less: used to generate desktop-specific styles, includes _styles.less.
				/source: this subdirectory contains Less configuration files that invoke mixins from the Magento UI library.
				/source/_theme.less: overrides the default Magento UI library variables values.
