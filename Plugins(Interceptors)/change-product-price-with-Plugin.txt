Overview of changing product price with plugin in Magento 2

~ Step 1: Add di.xml file

Step 1: Add di.xml file

~ It is crucial to identify where the place you want to activate the plugin, and then add di.xml file. 
Here, the sample is the frontend area with the following content for the di.xml file.

<config>
  <type name="Magento\Catalog\Model\Product">
    <plugin name="change_product" type=" Commercers\Ticket\Plugin\Catalog\Model\Product " sortOrder="1" disabled="true"/>
  </type>
</config>

Step 2: Change the product price

Open folder “Commercers\Ticket\Plugin\Catalog\Model” to add new class Product.php. 
Please put the prefix “after” before one of two ways to change the product price:

~ Edit the values reported by an original method

~ Call some behaviors once an original method is called.

And the result when the original method getPrice() finishes is declared by the $result. 
For example, you will adjust the product price by multiply it with 2.

<?php
 
namespace Mageplaza\HelloWorld\Plugin;
 
class Product
{
    public function afterGetPrice(\Magento\Catalog\Model\Product $subject, $result)
    {
        return $result + 100;
    }
}

When step 2 has done, this means you can see the customization of the product price on the frontend. 
Hope you find it useful within running Magento 2 store.
